## Description (4000 characters max)

ClawControl is the mobile companion for your self-hosted OpenClaw AI assistant. Connect to your own server over any network — including Tailscale — and manage conversations, agents, skills, and scheduled tasks from anywhere.

**Real-Time Streaming Chat**
Watch responses flow in live with per-session stream isolation. Multiple agents can stream simultaneously without interfering with each other. Full Markdown rendering, syntax-highlighted code blocks with one-tap copy, and collapsible thinking blocks let you follow along as your AI reasons through complex problems.

**Multi-Agent Management**
Switch between agents without losing conversation context. Create custom agents with names, emojis, avatars, and dedicated workspaces. Override models on a per-agent basis. Monitor agent status in real-time.

**Subagent Visibility**
See when your agent spawns parallel sub-tasks. Inline status blocks show subagent progress, and you can pop out any subagent session into its own view for side-by-side work.

**Session Organization**
Sessions are grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, This Week) and searchable by title or message content. Unread badges keep you aware of background activity. Rename, delete, and navigate sessions from the collapsible sidebar.

**ClawHub Skill Marketplace**
Browse community-built skills with download counts, star ratings, and VirusTotal security scan badges. Install, enable, and manage skills directly from the app — no terminal required.

**Cron Job Dashboard**
View scheduled tasks, check next-run times, and pause or resume jobs on the go. Full detail views give you complete schedule and execution history.

**Full Server Configuration**
Configure your OpenClaw server without leaving the app. Three organized tabs cover Agent Defaults (model, thinking level, context limits), Tools & Memory (web search, code execution, memory backend), and Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage).

**Secure by Design**
Tokens are stored in iOS Keychain via Capacitor Secure Storage. Self-signed certificates are supported through Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU). Connect via password or token auth to servers on local networks, VPNs, or Tailscale.

**Built for Power Users**
Dark and light themes. Responsive layout adapts from iPhone to iPad. Keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflows. Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff keeps you connected.

ClawControl is open source (MIT) and connects to any OpenClaw-compatible server. Your data stays on your infrastructure.
