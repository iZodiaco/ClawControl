Welcome to ClawControl. This app helps you chat with OpenClaw AI assistants on your desktop and mobile devices. It has an easy-to-use interface and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## 📋 What ClawControl Does

ClawControl is a program that lets you talk to smart AI helpers called agents. You can chat with many agents at once. Each chat keeps things separate, so the helpers don’t get mixed up. The app looks clean and shows messages as they come. You can even copy code easily from chat.  

The app also lets you switch between different AI agents. You can create your own agents, change their names, and delete agents you don’t need. It shows how the AI thinks for hard tasks if you turn on “Thinking Mode.” That helps you follow the AI’s reasoning step-by-step.

ClawControl is built with modern tools to work smoothly on almost any device.
